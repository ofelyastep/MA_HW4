Social Network Analysis Project
Overview
Scenario
You're a part of the marketing department or a marketing agency, aiming to identify key individuals within a social network for targeted outreach. With budget constraints, your goal is to strategically select the most influential individuals for marketing efforts.
Tasks
The dataset connections.txt comprises edges representing relationships. Your tasks involve:
1.	Graph Creation: Construct a directed graph from the provided data.
2.	Bridge Identification: Determine nodes acting as bridges between different parts of the network.
3.	Graph Density: Calculate the density of the graph and provide insights.
4.	Node Connectivity: Identify nodes with the highest and lowest numbers of connections.
5.	Incoming/Outgoing Connections: Determine nodes with the highest incoming and outgoing connections.
6.	Centrality Analysis: Analyze closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality to pinpoint influential nodes.
7.	Community Detection: Implement a community detection algorithm to unveil distinct communities.
8.	Community Analysis: Explore the largest and smallest communities and draw conclusions.
9.	Top Community Analysis: Visualize the largest three communities, removing high-centrality nodes for insight.
10.	Influencer Identification: Visualize influencers within the top three communities.
11.	Action Plan Design:
•	Business Scenario: Choose a hypothetical business (telecom, marketing agency, etc.).
•	Marketing Budget: Define a hypothetical budget for marketing efforts.
•	Cost per Action: Determine the cost per action (advertisement cost).
•	Target Audience Decision: Decide which individuals to target based on analyses conducted.
Objectives
1.	Insight Generation: Extract valuable insights from the social network structure.
2.	Identification of Key Individuals: Pinpoint influential nodes for targeted marketing efforts.
3.	Strategic Planning: Design a focused action plan to optimize marketing efforts within budget constraints.
Execution
1.	Data Preparation: Ensure connections.txt is in the specified directory.
2.	Execution: Run the provided Python script (graph_analysis.py) to perform the analyses and generate insights.
3.	Interpretation: Review results, visualizations, and interpretations presented in the console or as saved output files/plots.
Note
•	Refer to code comments for detailed explanations of methodologies used.
•	Findings and interpretations will assist in decision-making for targeted marketing strategies.
